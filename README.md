Scorecard
=========

A simple, straight-forward scorekeeper app. 

The Scorecard! manages running score totals from round to round, for one to ten players. 

Originally created to help me with disc golf, this app is general enough to work for any sort of game that requires score tracking.

Three step approach:

   •Define how many players are playing

   •Enter their names

   •Start keeping score!
